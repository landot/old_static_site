    <p>Chart 1: Position, length, color hue</p>
    <p>This grouped bar chart uses 3 different encodings: position, length, and color hue. Each encoding is very useful in showing the point of this chart. Position on the X axis allows the reader to tell the three different groups of MIC needed to prevent bacterial growth. I wanted to be able to divide the MIC numbers into 3 main groups. One group (0-.99) would be an example the antibiotic being very effective since it would require less to stop growth. I also wanted to create a middle group (1-9.99) that represented the antibiotic being moderately effective. And lastly I wanted to show a grouping of MIC(10+) that were not very effective due to the higher concentration needed to stop growth. On the Y axis position is used to show the count of different types bacteria for each category of drug (penicilin, streptomycin, and neomycin) concentration. Color is used to be able to differentiate between the 3 antibiotics in the data with blue correlating to penicilin, orange correlating to streptomycin, and green correlating to neomycin. The reason I chose this grouped bar chart and these encodings was because I was trying to show the general effectiveness of each drug of the bacteria by grouping them by concentration needed to prevent growth. In the chart it can be seen that neomycin was one of the best antibiotics, requiring smaller concentrations to stop growth in a larger number of bacteria. Penicilin on the other hand required more concentration to stop growth in a higher number of bacteria. The colors were chosen so that there would be no trouble differentiating the antibiotics.</p>

    <p>Chart 2: Position, color hue, color saturation</p>
    <p>This heatmap chart uses 3 main encoding: position, color hue, and color saturation. Position is used through being able to correlated a rectangle to a column (antibiotic) and a row (bacteria). I wanted to use this kind of position encoding so that readers would be able to find a cell that they wanted to learn more about because it stuck out more compared to others and be able to correlate it to the MIC of an antibiotic on a specific bacteria. color hue is used largely to differentiate between the higher and lower numbers. I made it so that lower numbers would be a lighter blue, medium numbers would be a slightly darker blue, and high numbers would be red. I chose these colors so that the 'red' cells would stick out to the user. These cells meant that this antibiotic requires a much larger concentration needed to stop bacterial growth. I chose light blue to be used for the lower concentration numbers due to it not being an extremely normal and not eye-popping color that would take away from the intense red. Color saturation or shading is also used in this chart due to the gradient of colors being used to represent the MIC values. This color saturation allows the reader to be able to tell a difference between cells due to Weber's law. The key for this gradient can be seen on the right of the chart which allows users to either hover over a cell to get it's value or get an estimate from the key.</p>

    <p>Chart 3: Position along nonaligned scales, length, color</p>
    <p>This boxplot uses 3 main encodings: position along a nonaligned scale, length, and color. Position is used through nonaligned axis. In this chart this was done by have two different Y scales. The first chart goes from 0-17 average MIC and the second chart goes from 0-286 average MIC. These values were found through averaging each antibiotics effect on a specific bacteria. I chose nonaligned scales due to the fact that having tried them on the same scales caused them to be very spread out and harder to view. Length is used in this chart to show the range of the data along with the length of the different quartiles and seeing how the median is reflected in the chart. I chose length because I wanted to be show how positive gram staining bacteria had more clustered data and a lower median number. Negative gram staining on the other hand was all over the place and had a much higher range and median number. Color is used to differentiate between the two major categories (positive and negative gram staining) with positive being a more positive color (blue) and negative being a more negative color (red)</p>
